# ISOSEQ 16
Isomorphic Sequencer for monome norns and grid

## What it is

ISOSEQ is 16 step, 16 page/measure sequencer laid out in an isomorphic pattern.  All pages have the same set of scales.  Each row follows the Chromatic scale (12-note, half-tone Western).  Each row is a Perfect 4th apart, starting at the bottom.  The grid row closest to the player has the lowest pitches and the row furthest from the player has the highest pitches.  

ISOSEQ has 3 modes: pause, seq on, and edit.  In edit mode, the player can either edit a sequence on the displayed page, or s/he can play the notes in real time.

ISOSEQ display is divided into 3 pages:

1) set root note (6 octave range) and set tempo (BPM)
2) set song length from 1 thru 16 pages (measures), set pattern length from 2 to 16 steps, set currently playing page/measure, choose whether to auto-advance thru all available pages/measures (will advance thru the number of pages chosen in "# pages" 
3) load, save, or delete patterns including key, BPM, pattern length, number of pages, and auto-advance

## How things work

All encoders work the same on each page:

- ENC 1 changes display pages
- ENC 2 always adjusts items in the left column
- ENC 3 always adjusts items in the right column

Keys work differently based upon the config page displayed:

- KEY 1 always jumps into the norns settings/params view
- KEY 2 on config page 3 will back out of a mischosen action (don't want to delete or save)
- KEY 3 will start or pause the sequencer on config pages 1 and 2 and selects a load/save/delete action on config page 3
- Bonus! ALT (hold down KEY 1) and KEY 2 will create randon notes across all 16 pages/measures

## Additional features

- MIDI note and clock out
- MIDI clock in
- can turn on/off isomorphic background lights
- can change grid rotation (normal and 180 degrees), useful if need to flip grid due to connector position
- synth (Passersby) params fully adjustable
